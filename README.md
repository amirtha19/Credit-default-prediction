Credit default prediction is a crucial task in finance and risk management. It involves using historical data and various predictive modelling techniques to assess the likelihood that borrowers will default on their credit obligations, such as loans or credit card payments. The primary goal is to accurately identify high-risk borrowers and mitigate potential financial losses for lenders and investors.
